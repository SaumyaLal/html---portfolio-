<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Student at IPS ACADEMY, Indore | Trainee at Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India. Research and Development Sector.</p>

<p>I am currently studying at the IPS Academy in Indore, pursuing my degree in Bachelor of technology in Computer Science. After my 12th grade, I got my diploma in electronics and communication from Shri Vaishnav Polytechnic with a distinction. I led a few projects there while also becoming the class representative in my first year of the course. To integrate software technologies with electronic equipment, I have changed my degree to computer science and am currently taking online classes for programming in C++.
  I also love public speaking and won the title of best speaker in the 2017 National Indian Youth Parliament at both the preliminary stage and the final stage, held in Lucknow and Delhi, respectively.
  My hobby include article writing, and I have published a few on the site Mydramalist, one of them titled The Kawaii Factor in J-Dramas: Female Leads.</p>
